> add background colors flashing to the beat

> add collision for rotated walls
> maybe make walls move, maybe make dents in walls when you shoot them (overlay white or sth)

> make enemies walk around walls

> add blood particles, let them splash onto walls and stay there

> add animations
    (split player into legs and upper body; rotate legs according to movement, upper body according to aim)

> add music

> add different weapons
    (long range rifle)
    (mine-dropper that drops bullets where you stand that damage and maybe explode)
    (crazy guns with bullets that move in weird patterns)
    (random gun that shoots random types of bullets)
